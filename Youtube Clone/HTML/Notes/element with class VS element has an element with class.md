Good question! The difference lies in **CSS selectors** and how they target elements. Let‚Äôs break it down:  

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ `button.joinbtn` (No Space) ‚Äì Works ‚úÖ**
```css
button.joinbtn {
  /* Styles */
}
```
üîπ This selector **targets `<button>` elements** that **also have the class** `.joinbtn`.  
‚úÖ Example that this selector applies to:
```html
<button class="joinbtn">Join</button>
```

---

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ `button .joinbtn` (With Space) ‚Äì Doesn't Work ‚ùå**
```css
button .joinbtn {
  /* Styles */
}
```
üîπ This selector means:  
> **"Select any element with the class `.joinbtn` that is inside a `<button>` element."**  

‚ùå It doesn't work in your case because a `<button>` is **not** a container element‚Äîit doesn't usually have child elements like `<div>` or `<span>`.  
For this selector to work, your HTML would have to look like this:
```html
<button>
  <span class="joinbtn">Join</span>
</button>
```
Here, `.joinbtn` is inside the `<button>`, so `button .joinbtn` would work.

---

### **Conclusion:**
- **Use `button.joinbtn`** if you're styling a `<button>` element with a specific class.  
- **Use `button .joinbtn`** only if `.joinbtn` is inside the `<button>` as a separate element.
